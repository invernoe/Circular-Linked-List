# Circular-Linked-List
A mini project that implements a circular linked list using C++

By implementing certain functions which include:
Insert: function to insert a new node to the circular linked list
Delete: function to delete a certain node from the list
GetSize: function that returns how many nodes are in the list
ShowList: function that displays the list in the output for debugging

The circular linked list requires to structs to be present for it to work successfully:
Node: node structure that contains the key, which is the value the node contains and a pointer to the next node
List: a structure that only consists of a node pointer which points to the list's head
